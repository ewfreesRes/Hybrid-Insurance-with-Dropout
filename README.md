# Hybrid-Insurance-with-Dropout
Code to support the paper "Dependence Modeling of Multivariate Longitudinal Hybrid Insurance Data with Dropout".

Specifically:

*  The "OnlineSupplements9Sept2019.pdf" is a summary document.
*  The summary document is produced by the R markdown document "OnlineSupplements9Sept2019.Rmd". This code calls the following:
   *    'InsurApplications.Rmd' - an R markdown file of an overview of copula insurance applications 
   *    'GaussianCopulaDetails.Rmd' - an R markdown file of an overview of Gaussian copula details
    *    'TweedieGMMSimulation.Rmd' - an R markdown file of a simulation study of the multivariate Tweedie
   *    'LapseSimulation.Rmd' - an R markdown file of a lapse simultion study
   *    'CaseStudy2018.Rmd' - an R markdown file of an earlier version of the case study
